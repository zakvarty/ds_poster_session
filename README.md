# ds_poster_session
Materials for MSc Data Science session on making academic posters

# Session aims
The aims of this session are
 - Hour 1: Poster critique:
     - what is an academic poster session?
     - what makes a a good academic poster?
 - Hour 2: Poster construction
     - How to use LaTeX templates to create and academic poster. 
     - Editing your template 
     - Filing your template

This is a lot of material to cover in two hours, don't worry if it doesn't all make sense right away. 
You will forget most of it before you have to make your poster anyway. 
The point is to give you a minimal working template and materials that you can look back on when changing it in a few months.  

# Session resources

Slides for session: 

## Posters for discussion segment
Poster pdfs to be critiqued in first hour please download before the session if possible.


## Poster template for interactive segments (second hour):

Check that these will open and compile with your preferred LaTeX editor. 
Alternatively, or upload to an online editor such as Overleaf.com.

To do this create an Overleaf account > new project > upload project > upload template.zip and template_empty.zip

## Links to other latex templates:

## Links to Rmarkdown templates: 
  Some of you might be experiences in using markdown to produce reports. When combined with appropriate css markdown can also be used to produce posters. Links to some templates for those who are so inclined are given here. We do not provide guidance on how to use these because of the limited time available in the session. 
## Links to powerpoint template: 
  If you really don't want to typeset your poster a minimal powerpoint template is provided. Photoshop or open source alternatives (InkScape, Krita, GIMP) can also be used to make effective academic posters.
