# ds_poster_session
Materials for MSc Data Science session on making academic posters

# Session aims
The aims of this session are
 - Hour 1: Poster critique:
     - what is an academic poster session?
     - what makes a a good academic poster?
 - Hour 2: Poster construction
     - How to use LaTeX templates to create and academic poster. 
     - Editing your template 
     - Filing your template

This is a lot of material to cover in two hours, don't worry if it doesn't all make sense right away. 
You will forget most of it before you have to make your poster anyway. 
The point is to give you a minimal working template and materials that you can look back on when changing it in a few months.

## Links to Rmarkdown templates: 
  Some of you might be experiences in using markdown to produce reports. When combined with appropriate css markdown can also be used to produce posters. Links to some templates for those who are so inclined are given here. We do not provide guidance on how to use these because of the limited time available in the session. 
## Links to powerpoint template: 
  If you really don't want to typeset your poster a minimal powerpoint template is provided. Photoshop or open source alternatives (InkScape, Krita, GIMP) can also be used to make effective academic posters.
